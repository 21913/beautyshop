The virtual store for skin care products, Beauty Shop, was used.
Operations in a SQL database were used, which created a database called Beautystore containing the tables of users and products.

The product data contains different values, such as strings, ints and booleans.
All CRUD operations are working as expected. An operation was created for All inserted products, which can be edited, updated and deleted if necessary.
The application is connected to the database.
The user can access their account or create a new account. The user's password is encrypted.
